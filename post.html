						<p>Hello all,</p>
						<p>I'm Jmaster, the founder of Jmascot.  As a metaphysician, I have been doing fortune telling and energy work since I was 13,  and since the year of 2000, I started thinking of some ways to actually change our lives to the better, instead of just predicting and predicting.  Here I created this brand Jmascot, as "J" is actually the first letter of my name while "mascot" means something to bring us good fortune.  In this website, I will share with you some of my experiences and knowledge base on both science and metaphysics, as well as some of my exclusively formulated products that I believe are beneficial to us to live a better life.  You are most welcome to contact me through this site for any enquiries. </p>
						<p>Enjoy and Merry Christmas!!  </p>
						<p>Jmaster </p>

						<p>I haven't decided the official name of this product, but just too many of my friends who are in the know asking me to hurry up the production of this item.  I just temporarily call this Jmascot Stone.  This is a product that emits far infrared and negative ions that are very good for our bodies to ease our tension and stress and it is also scientifically proven that can reduce EMF readings (electromagnetic frequencies).  It is also believed to protect you from any source of negativity and to increace your energy level.  All you have to do is to carry this and let it do the job for you.  Nice stuff huh?  But this is not designed for children, pregnant women or women who plan to have babies.  I would not say it is bad for those people but I just haven't tested it before with those people, and I have no plan to test it with those people.  Besides those people, this product basically works fine for everybody.  It is now only available for private sales, not to the public....yet (because I still have to work on so many things like the overall design of this site and disclaimers as so on....)  More photos and details will be available in the near future.</p>
						<p>Sales are not available to public yet.</p>
						<!--p>Size: around 1.5 inches long 0.5 inches deep</p-->
						<!--p>Price:  HK$ 500 or US$65 each </p-->
